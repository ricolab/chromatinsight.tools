\alias{getheatmap2}
\title{Deprecated version of getheatmap that uses the pattern of the filename
rather than the grouping file.
Calculates the heatmap of a set of ChromHMM output binary files.
Parameters:
pattern: to select the files from the filename. Asterisks (*) as wildcard.
coord: the coordinates of the region to extract, such as
chrX:73,040,484-73,072,558 (this parameter is mandatory)
histmod: the name of the column from which extract the data, such as the
histone mark. Default is "H3K27ac".
windowsize: the number of bases in each ChromHMM window. Default is 200.
direc: directory or folder where the data are (omit to use the working
directory).
filename: the filename to save a 1800x1000 px image with the heatmap. If
omitted, it will just show it in the plot area.}
\usage{
getheatmap2(
  pattern = "*",
  coord = "",
  histmod = "H3K27ac",
  windowsize = 200,
  filename = "",
  direc = ""
)
